    	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
        
        <h3>Define the goals for the client company; how well are those currently being met?</h3>
        
        	<ol>
        		<li>Promote the the team as a competitive team</li>
        	    <li>Fund raise for the team</li>
        	    <li>Raise Awareness of the abilities of physically challeged athletes in the area?</li>
        	</ol>
 
		<p>I feel that the goals of this site are being met to an extent. We promote have the site that we can point point people to if they want information on the team or the sport. Last year was the first year in quite some time that the players did not have to pay the complete travel cost for the season so the fund raising is working. I do feel that promoting the businesses that donate to our team on the web site would be a great way of thanking them and possiblly increasing future contrabutions. We have always done a great job of promoting our abilities and disability awareness and it seems like because of the website we of gotten with some groups that have became reglar events for our team. Even though we have teams that we compet with on the court, I feel that off the court there is no cometition as we all ultimately have the same goals.</p>
        
		<h3>Define the goals for the consumer/end-user of the site; how well are those currently being met?</h3>
        
		<p>I think that the goals for the end user is simplely to get information about what is going on with the team? This goal is not being met very well at this time. I think that was part of the reason I was asked to take over the management of the site it was becoming hard for us to get the pictures and updates on the site in a timely manner. I also think the text and background color makes it hard to read.</p>       
        
		<h3>Identify specific ways your project design and development will aid in the above goals being achieved.</h3>

		<p>I will address these the issues with this site by using the team colors as the colors for the site, and the site will be responsive. I will also address the multiple coding errors I found when I ran the current html through a validator.</p>
