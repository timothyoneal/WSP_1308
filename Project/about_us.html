If not but you are ready to start exercising in a fun, team environment, come on out. Currently, the youngest member of the team is 16 and the oldest is 61. The team currently does not have extra sport wheelchairs, but you can try one of ours if you come out to watch us practice. Bring your family and friends.</p>
